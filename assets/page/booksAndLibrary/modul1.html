      <h1>Modul 1: Principal Strategies in Short Conversations</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>A. Objectives</h2>
        <p>After studying this material, students are able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Put more focus on the last line</li>
          <li>Find out the similarity in meaning (synonym) between the questions and answer choices</li>
          <li>Be familiar with the words of similar sounds which may distract or trick them when answering</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>B. Material Description</h2>
        <h3>1.a. Focus on the Last Line</h3>
        <p>In short conversations, it's important to focus on the last line—the utterances spoken by the second speaker. These lines are often related to both the question and the answer.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          Woman: Do you know where Dean Nicholson’s office is?<br />
          Man: There’s a directory in the entrance way.<br />
          Narrator: What does the man imply about Dean Nicholson’s office?
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. He doesn’t know where the office is.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 1.1</h3>
        <p>Listen to the following short conversations. Complete the scripts, underline the key words, and choose the best answer.</p>
        <!-- Questions will go here (format skipped for brevity) -->
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>1.b. Answer with Synonyms</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, answers use different words that mean the same as those in the questions. Understanding synonyms is essential.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          Woman: How’s your research project coming, Mike?<br />
          Man: So far, so good.<br />
          Narrator: What does Mike mean?
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D. Until at the moment, he has not had any problems.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 1.2</h3>
        <p>Do the same with the next set of dialogues. Focus on the use of synonyms.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>1.c. Avoid Homophones</h3>
        <p>Homophones are words that sound similar but have different meanings. They can be used to confuse listeners, so learn to identify and eliminate them.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          Man: I’d like coffee with milk, please.<br />
          Woman: Would you like a large or a small mug?<br />
          Narrator: What did the woman ask?
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D. what size mug the man wants</p>

        <h3>Exercise 1.3</h3>
        <p>Write down the conversations and underline the homophones in the answer choices.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>C. Review Exercises</h2>
        <p>This is a review of the strategies: last line, synonyms, and homophones. Write down the conversation, identify the key elements, and select the best answer.</p>
