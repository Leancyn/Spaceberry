        <h1>Modul 3: Negative Expressions</h1>

        <section>
  <h2>A. Objectives</h2>
  <p>After studying this material, students are able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognize and understand various types of negatives</li>
    <li>Recognize and understand the negative expressions found in short conversations</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>B. Material Description</h2>
  <h3>1.a. Negative Markers</h3>
  <p>Examples of negative expressions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Not / n't:</strong> e.g., He <em>couldn't</em> pass the test = He failed</li>
    <li><strong>Never, nobody, none:</strong> e.g., Paul <em>never</em> makes his bed = He is lazy</li>
    <li><strong>Negative prefixes:</strong> un-, in-, dis- (e.g., <em>irresponsible</em> = ignorant)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <blockquote>
    Woman: Mitch and Lynn must have a lot in common since they’re both economics majors.<br/>
    Man: Oh, I didn’t realize that Mitch was an economics major too.<br/>
    Narrator: What does the man imply?
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B. He does not think they own something in common.</p>

  <h3>Exercise 3.1</h3>
  <p>Listen to the following short conversations. Write down the conversations, underline the negative words, and choose the best answer.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>1.b. Double Negatives</h3>
  <p>Combining two negatives usually creates a positive meaning in English.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"It is not impossible" = It is possible</li>
    <li>"Nobody isn't at home" = Everybody is at home</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    Man: I’d like to return this sweater because it’s too small. I don’t have the receipt though.<br/>
    Woman: You could exchange the sweater for another size. But if you don’t have the receipt, I won’t be able to give your money back.
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. He can only get a refund with a receipt.</p>

  <h3>Exercise 3.2</h3>
  <p>Underline double negative expressions and choose the best answer.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>1.c. Almost Negatives</h3>
  <p>Words like <em>hardly, barely, rarely</em> imply a meaning that is almost negative.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Man: Only rarely have I tasted such delicious meat.<br/>
    Narrator: What does the man mean?
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. This is the best meat he’s tasted in a long time.</p>

  <h3>Exercise 3.3</h3>
  <p>Identify and underline almost negative expressions in the dialogues.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>1.d. Comparatives with Negatives</h3>
  <p>Negative comparatives imply a superlative meaning. For example: “Nothing is more expensive than this” = This is the most expensive.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Man: Nothing could have been more difficult than that exam.<br/>
    Narrator: What does the man mean?
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. The test wasn’t easy at all.</p>

  <h3>Exercise 3.4</h3>
  <p>Identify comparative structures with negative markers and select the most accurate meaning.</p>
</section>

<section>
