        <h2>B. Material Description</h2>
        <h3>2.a. Questions about People, Things, and Places</h3>
        <p>Short conversations often include questions about people, activities, and locations. Even if not clearly stated, students must infer the correct answers based on key words and context.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Woman: Charlie has the potential to be a professional musician, but he is too lazy to practice.<br />
          Man: What a shame!<br />
          Narrator: What does the woman say about Charlie?<br />
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. He is very talented, but he’ll never be professional musician because he does not practice.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>2.b. Who and What in Passive Sentences</h3>
        <p>In short conversations, sometimes the answers are in passive voice. Students must be aware of the subject and object in both active and passive structures.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Woman: Why were you so late in getting home from work?<br />
          Man: My boss had me finish all the month-end reports.<br />
          Narrator: What does the man mean?<br />
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. He was told to stay late and accomplish some work.
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>C. Review Exercises</h2>
        <p>Review questions about people, objects, locations, and passive structures. Listen to the conversations and determine the correct answer based on context clues.</p>
